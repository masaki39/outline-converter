# How to use 

This plugin extracts list rows from the current note. 
It automatically identifies the indentation level and connects them according to your settings.

There are **three commands**.
The first one executes as configured, while the latter two are designed for academic writing.

If you imported notes named `[[@citekey]]` from Zotero through [Citations](https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) or [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) or [Zotlit](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-zotlit) plugin, the preset commands automatically convert the links into pandoc citation style.

You can choose whether the indentation level include or note.
Add customized text before or after each text.
