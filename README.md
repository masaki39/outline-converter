### Custom Converter

Control text transformation at each indentation level (1-5). For each level, add text before/after content or ignore content entirely.

Lines starting with `//` (with or without space) will have their content ignored, but before/after text will still be applied.

### Replacement (Find & Replace)

Apply up to 5 find-and-replace operations with regex support. Replacements are processed sequentially.

### Section Insertion

Insert content from other sections using `[[#SectionName]]` syntax. Works with both `[[#Section]]` and `![[#Section]]` formats.

### Export Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy to clipboard** | Copies the result to your clipboard |
| **Append to cursor** | Inserts text at your current cursor position |
| **Append to bottom** | Adds text to the end of the active note |
| **Replace section** | Replaces a specific section (creates if doesn't exist) |

## Additional Commands

### Fold Commands

Quickly fold all items at a specific indentation level (1-5) using the command palette.

### Swap Lines Commands
